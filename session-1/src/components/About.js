                <p>We are a group of students who have come together to create this platform.
                Our main goal is to provide an easy and convenient way for people
                to find the best deals on products they need, without having
                to search through multiple websites or platforms.
                That's why we created e-commerce - an online marketplace where you can easily compare prices
                and find the most affordable offers in real time.</p>
